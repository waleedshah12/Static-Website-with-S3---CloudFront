🌍 Static Website Hosting with S3 + CloudFront
This project demonstrates how to host a secure, globally distributed static website using Amazon S3 and CloudFront. It’s part of my hands-on AWS learning journey, where I’m building real-world infrastructure to deepen my cloud engineering skills.
🚀 What I Built
- A fully functional static website hosted on Amazon S3
- Integrated with Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery and performance optimization
- Configured HTTPS using an SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager
- Implemented secure bucket policies and public access restrictions for best practices
🔧 Key Features
- ✅ Fast global delivery with CloudFront CDN
- ✅ Secure HTTPS access with custom domain support
- ✅ Cost-effective and scalable static hosting
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code (optional) using AWS Console or Terraform (if applicable)
📸 Project Assets
- Architecture diagram outlining the setup
- Screenshots of the deployed site and AWS configurations
💡 What I Learned
- How to configure S3 for static website hosting
- Setting up CloudFront distributions with custom origins
- Managing IAM policies and bucket permissions
- The importance of secure, scalable design in cloud architecture
📌 Next Steps
I’m now moving into dynamic web hosting by deploying a WordPress application on EC2 with RDS, diving deeper into compute and database services.
